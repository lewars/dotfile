* Retro
** Good
- Making progress on Jenkins migration
- Group effort
** Bad
- Technology not working (when it should) especially around attaching and mounting k8s snapshots volumns and even PersistentVolume in prod
- Thorough experimentation with novel ways of doing things with our stack before thinking it was done
